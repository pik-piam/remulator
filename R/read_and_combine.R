#' Read multiple report mif files from REMIND or MAgPIE and combine into single magpie object
#' 
#' This function reads model output from mif files from the provided list of folders. It also reads the GAMS
#' modelstatus from the fulldata.gdx and appends it to the report. If more than one folder is
#' given it combines the contents of the multiple reports into a single magpie object and returns it.
#' If the name of an output file is provided the object is additionally stored in this file. In each of the
#' folders there must be a report_scenname.mif, a fulldata.gdx, a spatial_header.rda, and config.Rdata.
#' 
#' 
#' @param list_of_directories Vector of strings providing the folder names from which reports will be read.
#' @param outfile Path to an output file which the output of the function can optionally be stored to.
